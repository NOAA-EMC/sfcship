All statistics are for data with gross errors excluded.  Gross error
limits for observations compared to NCEP first guess and analysis
fields are as follows:

AP:  15.0 mb
AT:  15.0 degrees Celsius
WD:  100 degrees
WS:  15.0 m/s
SST:  5.0 degrees Celsius
WV:  25.0 m/s

                      Explanation of fields:

Date####: Last day for the monthly statistics
WMO##   : WMO number of buoy or Ship's Call Sign
Sns     : Sensor Name :
          AP (Pressure), AT (Air Temp), SST (Sea Surf Temp), WS (Wind Sp),
          WD (Wind Dir), WV (Wind vector), APT (Tendency), HUM (Humidity),
          TD (Dew Point).
Orig    : GTS Origin of the data (ALL or cccc from GTS Bulletin header)
C       : GTS code (B: BUOY, S:SHIP, Y:SYNOP)
Cntr#   : Monitoring Center producing the stats (e.g. ECMWF, UKMO, NCO, CMM)
Lat##   : Last Latitude of buoy/ship during the month
Long##  : Last Longitude of buoy/ship during the month
Rcei    : Total number of obs received at the center including obs not used
Acpt    : Total number of obs accepted by the model
GE#     : Number of Gross Errors (i.e. number of (Obs-Field) exceeding limits))
Bias#   : Mean Bias (Obs-Field)
SD##    : Standard Deviation, SD = RMS (Obs-Field-Bias);
          For Wind Vectors (WV), by convention, SD = RMS(WS/Rate - Field)
RMS#    : Root Mean Square, RMS = RMS (Obs-Field);
          For Wind Vectors (WV), by convention, RMS=RMS(SQRT(Vec(WV-Field)**2))
Rate    : Mean (Obs/Field)
F       : Flag for Field used : A=Analysis, G=First Guess, B=Both
